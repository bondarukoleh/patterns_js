Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other
complex set of classes.

A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly.
However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features,
but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.

Instead of making your code work with dozens of the framework classes directly, you create a facade class which
encapsulates that functionality and hides it from the rest of the code. This structure also helps you to minimize the
effort of upgrading to future versions of the framework or replacing it with another one. The only thing you’d need to
change in your app would be the implementation of the facade’s methods.
