# The Landscape of Testing
Tests, much like the rest of our code, deal in layers of abstraction and granularity. \
A good testing methodology will involve tests for all distinct parts of a code base:
- Prove fulfillment: Tests allow us to prove to ourselves and our stakeholders that expectations and requirements are
fulfilled.
- Have confidence: Tests allow us and our colleagues to have confidence in our code baseâ€”both that it works correctly 
and that it can accommodate changes without faults arising unbeknownst to us.
- Share knowledge: Tests allow us to share vital knowledge about how parts of our code operate together. In a sense, 
they are a form of documentation.
