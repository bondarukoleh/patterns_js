### Model of a problem
A model or *conceptual model* is a schematic or representation that describes how something works.
We create and adapt models all the time without realizing it. Over time, as you gain more information about a problem
domain, your model will improve to better match reality.

## Writing code for humans
When we write code, it's essential to consider how human brains will consume it.

Readability. Meaningful abstractions.
