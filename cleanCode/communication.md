# Communication and Advocacy
Understand the problem -> Find the solution -> Implement it -> collect feedback -> repeat;

## Planning and setting requirements
### Understanding user needs
- Who are our users?: What characteristics do they have? What devices do they use?
- What are they trying to do?: What actions are they trying to carry out? What's their ultimate goal?
- How do they currently do it?: What set of steps are they currently taking to reach their goal? Are there any notable
issues with their current method?
- What problems do they experience doing it this way?: Does it take a long time? Is it cognitively expensive? Is it
difficult to use?

### Communication strategies
- Ensuring good feedback with colleagues
- Receiving correct bug reports
- Actioning improvements and fixes
- Receiving user requirements and wishes
- Announcing changes or issues
- Agreeing on conventions and standards
- Making decisions about libraries and frameworks
