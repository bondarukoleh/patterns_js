# Communication and Advocacy
Understand the problem -> Find the solution -> Implement it -> collect feedback -> repeat;

## Planning and setting requirements
### Understanding user needs
- Who are our users?: What characteristics do they have? What devices do they use?
- What are they trying to do?: What actions are they trying to carry out? What's their ultimate goal?
- How do they currently do it?: What set of steps are they currently taking to reach their goal? Are there any notable
issues with their current method?
- What problems do they experience doing it this way?: Does it take a long time? Is it cognitively expensive? Is it
difficult to use?

### Communication strategies
- Ensuring good feedback with colleagues
- Receiving correct bug reports
- Actioning improvements and fixes
- Receiving user requirements and wishes
- Announcing changes or issues
- Agreeing on conventions and standards
- Making decisions about libraries and frameworks

If you would like to implement something, nice thing is to explain why it is needed from user perspective, that's how 
you can easily prove your point. \
Have small and focused communications \
Ask stupid questions and have wild ideas \
One of the best ways to learn about a new code base is through **pair programming**, new guy sit alongside a more
experienced programmer and collaborate together on bug fixes or feature implementations. \

### Driving systemic change
The steps involved in creating systemic change are as follows:
1. QUALIFY: Articulate the problem with specific examples: Describe the problem in a way that makes sense even to people
that aren't fully immersed in the problem domain.
2. FEEDBACK: Gather feedback from other people: Gather thoughts and suggestions from other people.
3. IDEATE: Collaborate on possible solutions: Source ideas on possible solutions from multiple people. Don't try to
reinvent the wheel. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.
4. RAISE: Raise the problem alongside possible solutions: Depending on what the problem is, raise it to the appropriate
people.
5. IMPLEMENT: Collaboratively pick a solution and begin work: Presuming that you are still considering this problem
is worth pursuing, you can begin to implement the most preferred solution, possibly in an isolated and Proof of Concept
kind of way.
6. MEASURE: Check in frequently on the success of the solution: Get feedback from people and seek quantifiable data to
discern whether the selected solution is working as expected.

One of the traps in creating systemic change is to wait too long or to be too cautious in approaching the problem.
