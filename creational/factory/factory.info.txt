Factory - is a creational design pattern that provides an ability to creating objects in a superclass,
  but allows subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created.

Factory used as superclass, and we ask it to create object for us, but depending on our purpose.
To make it work - objects that we create in Factory should have same interface.

Abstract factories - bunch of factories grouped together.
