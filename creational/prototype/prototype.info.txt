Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling
 to their specific classes.

Designs that make heavy use of Composite and Decorator can often benefit from using Prototype. Applying the pattern lets
 you clone complex structures instead of re-constructing them from scratch.

Sometimes Prototype can be a simpler alternative to Memento. This works if the object, the state of which you want to
 store in the history, is fairly straightforward and doesnâ€™t have links to external resources, or the links are easy to
 re-establish.
